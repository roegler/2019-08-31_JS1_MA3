6. List two examples of bad JavaScript code.

//Example one:

//should be uppercase.


//Example two:

var hours = new Date().getHours();
    if (hours < 18) {
        //some code here
            if (hours >= 16) {
                //some code here
                    if (hours < 12) {
                         //some code here
                    } else {

                    }
